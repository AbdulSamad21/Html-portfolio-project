<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Greetings, everyone. I'm Abdul Samad residing in Rawalpindi, Pakistan. I completed my matriculation from Sadeeqa's Learning System (SLS) in 2016 and pursued FSc (pre-eng) at Punjab College in 2018.

  In 2019, I commenced my Bachelorâ€™s in Software Engineering at Foundation University Islamabad (FUI), culminating in the completion of my degree in 2024. This program not only honed my programming skills but also enriched my proficiency in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, boot strap and Microsoft Office applications.
  
  Embarking on my professional journey as a Data Vendor in 2019 within the telecommunications sector, I further developed my communication skills and refined my ability to provide excellent customer support in English. This role equipped me with a solid foundation for navigating diverse challenges and fostering meaningful connections..</p>
